# Face Recognition Door Lock
This is a facial recognition door lock which can recognize a persons face at the door and then notifies the owner. If it is a face that is recognized then the owner open the door by using a code to tell the lock to turn and unlock.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My Second Milestone was building the lock and being able to set up the camera and connect it to my raspberry pi. I inserted the motor on the track in the box and screwed it tightly to close it. I connected the wires to the arduino and when i uploaded it the lock opened and closed. 

With the camera I inserted a command to test the it, (raspistill -v -o test.jpg) from the raspberry pi's official website; https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#raspistill. Immediately the feed shows up on the monitors screen for five seconds as a preview.

# First Milestone
  

For my first milestone I finished installing the aws cli, Amazon Rekognition, DynamoDB, a custom Alexa skill and AWS IoT. I used the access policy that was already given to me, filled in the information and all the keys that I recieved through creating my buckets and collections in DynamoDB and S3. 
The aws cli is is the command line interface, 

I was also able to create the IndexFaces function to identify a person's name by recognizing an image of their face from the S3 bucket I made.

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was Simon Says. I used a PCB board to connect the electronic components together. The capacitor was used to prevent sudden surges and drops in the electric currents in the entire circuit. I also used a microcontroller, LED lights and a buzzer. Most of my project was soldering all the individual parts onto the PCB board. I did struggle with one of the switches which provided the power fo rthe game. I soldered it too much which caused it to melt. So a bigger switch was what I added with wires that I soldered onto the PCB board and the two pins on the new switch.
